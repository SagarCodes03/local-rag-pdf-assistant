Intentionally weak: one SEED blurb for all questions (not per-case RAG).
Empty response contexts so faithfulness uses dataset case.contexts.
Do not treat high scores with a smarter mock as product quality.

SEED = "A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built completely from scratch using Python, FAISS, Sentence Transformers, and a local Qwen 2.5 model. The application allows users to ask natural language questions about one or more PDF documents. Instead of relying only on the LLM's internal knowledge, it retrieves the most relevant document chunks using semantic vector search and generates grounded answers based on the retrieved context. This project was built by directly implementing the core RAG pipeline instead of relying on high-level frameworks such as LangChain or LlamaIndex. The goal was to gain a deeper understanding of each stage of the RAG workflow, including document processing, chunking, embedding generation, vector indexing, semantic retrieval, and grounded answer generatio"
